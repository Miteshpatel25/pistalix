      Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps developers write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Additionally, it provides improvements to the developer experience, like live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

      Redux can be used together with React, or with other view libraries. The Redux file size is small, 2kB, including dependencies.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
