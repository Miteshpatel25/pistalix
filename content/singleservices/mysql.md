what_service: 'What MySQL is?'
service_small_desc: 'Many computer programs, including web-based programs like blogs, photo galleries, and content management systems need to store and retrieve data. For example, blog software needs to store the posts (ie, articles) you write and retrieve them when a visitor goes to your site. Similarly, photo galleries store information about their pictures (for example, for sites that allow users to rate the photos, the numerical rating for each picture is stored in a database). Instead of reinventing the wheel and implementing their own system of storing and retrieving data.'

    description: 'To make it easy for other programs to access data through them, many database software support a computer language called "SQL" (often pronounced as "sequel"). SQL was specially designed for such a purpose. Programs that want the database software to handle the low-level work of managing data simply use that language to send it instructions.'

    description: 'There are many databases that support the use of SQL to access their data, among them MySQL. In other words, MySQL is just the brand of one database software, one of many. These database is very popular among programs that run on websites (probably because they are free), which is why you often see it being advertised in the feature lists of web hosts, as well as being listed as one of the "system requirements" for certain web software (like blogs and content management systems).'

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
